Here are some things to know as we start this unit on 3D printing
1. Original work only: It is expected that all work, designs and models are of your own creation.
2. Financial cost: There is a cost towards 3D printing that we must be mindful of
3. Environmental Cost: As well as the financial cost, there is as well waste and plastic being produced which has an environmental cost
4. Be Patient: 3D printing is a time-intensive process. Large or detailed designs may take several hours or even days to print, so plan accordingly and be mindful of deadlines.
5. Design for Feasibility: Ensure your models are structurally sound and can be printed successfully. Overhangs, thin walls, or intricate details may require adjustments to avoid printing failures.
6. Operation: The 3D printer is a new, and potentially dangerous piece of technology. For now, only teachers who understand the printer will be able to operate it
7. Keep Designs Appropriate: All designs must align with school policies and be respectful to others.
8. Iterate Thoughtfully: You may need to revise and improve your designs after initial tests. Be open to feedback and use failed prints as learning opportunities.
10. Share Resources Fairly: The 3D printer is a shared resource. Ensure your print times are reasonable and consider the needs of others in the class.
11. Minimize Waste: Use supports, rafts, and infills sparingly and only when necessary to reduce plastic waste.
12. Color of the print will be random and will be printed using filament that is already loaded. Special filament/color requests may be submitted, but they may be denied
