## Include the STL file

Be sure to submit an STL file with each of your portfolio posts.

> [!TIP]
> 
> The easiest way to add your STL file to a portfolio post is to simply drag and drop it into the post you've created on Notion.

## What is an STL file?

In the same way that a JPEG file holds the data that describes an image, and an MP3 file holds data that describes a song, a STL file holds data that describes the 3D models we create in TinkerCad.

## How to I get my STL file?

At the top right of TinkerCad, click on **Export**:

Next, click on .STL, then save it to a folder on your computer. It is recommended that you create a folder made specifically for this module of the course, and keep all the .STL files you download from TinkerCad there.

>[!warning]
> 
> When saving a model in TinkerCad, if you have only part of the model selected when going to export, it will default to "The selected shape", meaning that it will export only what you have highlighted. Make sure you have either nothing selected, everything selected, or you remember to toggle to "Everything in this design" when exporting so that your full design is included in the STL file that TinkerCad creates.
