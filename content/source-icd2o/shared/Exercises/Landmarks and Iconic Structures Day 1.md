## Objective
You will select a real-life landmark or building to recreate through 3D modeling. The goal is to enhance their understanding of scale, proportion, and detail, emphasizing accuracy and craftsmanship in their designs. This hands-on experience will build foundational skills essential for creating realistic and precise 3D models.

## Academic Integrity
For this 3D printed Landmarks and Iconic Structures project, it is imperative that all work submitted is your own original creation. Academic integrity is a cornerstone of our learning community. Therefore, copying designs or using pre-existing models from others and submitting them as your own is strictly prohibited and will be treated as plagiarism. Each student is expected to independently research, design, and create their model using TinkerCAD. Your unique approach, creativity, and problem-solving skills are crucial to this project. Remember, this assignment is not just about the final product, but also about the process of learning, designing, and creating. Any breach of these principles will be taken seriously and will result in disciplinary action. Please refer to [[3D Printing Principles and Rules]] for all of the rules.

## Choosing your landmark: 

>[!tip] One person per landmark so let me know what you decide!

Iconic Structures: Widely recognized and well-known globally; these structures carry international fame and symbolize larger ideas or eras
1. Eiffel Tower (Paris, France): Metal latticework, tapering shape.
2. Taj Mahal (Agra, India): Symmetrical structure, domes, minarets.
3. Colosseum (Rome, Italy): Elliptical structure, arches, exterior ruins.
4. Sydney Opera House (Sydney, Australia): Shell-like roof structures, waterfront setting.
5. Empire State Building (New York, USA): Art deco style, height, symmetrical windows.
6. Big Ben (London, UK): Clock faces, Gothic Revival details, height proportion.
7. Sagrada Familia (Barcelona, Spain): Complex facades, spires, Gaudi's style.
8. The Louvre (Paris, France): Historical palace and modern glass pyramid.

Landmarks: Significant, often locally or regionally recognized for historical, cultural, or architectural importance
1. Saint Basil's Cathedral (Moscow, Russia): Colorful onion domes, and facade patterns.

## TinkerCad design
Begin creating your 3D model in TinkerCad based on your chosen Landmark. Focus on capturing the overall shape and proportions. Experiment with different techniques to enhance the accuracy and realism of your model.

## Feedback Session
At the end of each class, get your kind, specific and helpful peer feedback. Make note of what the feedback was in your notion post and who it came from. Reflect on the feedback received and identify areas for improvement in your design.
