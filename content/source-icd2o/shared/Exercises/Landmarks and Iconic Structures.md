## Objective
You will select a real-life landmark or building to recreate through 3D modeling. The goal is to enhance their understanding of scale, proportion, and detail, emphasizing accuracy and craftsmanship in their designs. This hands-on experience will build foundational skills essential for creating realistic and precise 3D models.
## Success criteria
Your 3D model should accurately represent the chosen landmark or building, demonstrating attention to scale, proportion, and detail. Ensure that the dimensions and features of the model align closely with the real-life structure, using reference images or measurements for accuracy. The design should showcase craftsmanship by being clean and well-constructed, free of obvious errors or structural flaws. Models should be realistic and include recognizable details that capture the essence of the landmark. Additionally, your project should reflect effort and creativity in problem-solving challenges encountered during the modeling process.
## Academic Integrity
For this 3D printed Landmarks and Iconic Structures project, it is imperative that all work submitted is your own original creation. Academic integrity is a cornerstone of our learning community. Therefore, copying designs or using pre-existing models from others and submitting them as your own is strictly prohibited and will be treated as plagiarism. Each student is expected to independently research, design, and create their model using TinkerCAD. Your unique approach, creativity, and problem-solving skills are crucial to this project. Remember, this assignment is not just about the final product, but also about the process of learning, designing, and creating. Any breach of these principles will be taken seriously and will result in disciplinary action. Please refer to [[3D Printing Principles and Rules]] for all of the rules.

## What you'll need to begin
Ensure that you are on our classroom for TinkerCad and review the [[File submission (TinkerCAD)|file submission standards]] as well as the [[3D Printing Principles and Rules]]. You will need a pencil and paper and to find a partner to give and receive peer feedback.

## Choosing your landmark

>[!tip] One person per landmark so let me know what you decide!

Iconic Structures: Widely recognized and well-known globally; these structures carry international fame and symbolize larger ideas or eras
1. Eiffel Tower (Paris, France): Metal latticework, tapering shape.
2. Taj Mahal (Agra, India): Symmetrical structure, domes, minarets.
3. Colosseum (Rome, Italy): Elliptical structure, arches, exterior ruins.
4. Sydney Opera House (Sydney, Australia): Shell-like roof structures, waterfront setting.
5. Empire State Building (New York, USA): Art deco style, height, symmetrical windows.
6. Big Ben (London, UK): Clock faces, Gothic Revival details, height proportion.
7. Sagrada Familia (Barcelona, Spain): Complex facades, spires, Gaudi's style.
8. The Louvre (Paris, France): Historical palace and modern glass pyramid.
9. Leaning Tower of Pisa (Italy): Tilt, Romanesque architecture, cylindrical shape.
10. Chrysler Building (New York, USA): Art Deco style, terraced crown, steel cladding.
11. The Great Sphinx of Giza (Egypt): Colossal statueâ€™s body and face, desert setting.

Landmarks: Significant, often locally or regionally recognized for historical, cultural, or architectural importance
1. Saint Basil's Cathedral (Moscow, Russia): Colorful onion domes, and facade patterns.
2. Neuschwanstein Castle (Germany): Romanesque Revival, towers, turrets.
3. Forbidden City (Beijing, China): Traditional Chinese architecture, symmetry.
4. Machu Picchu (Peru): Incan architecture, terraces, mountainous landscape.
5. Stonehenge (United Kingdom): Stone arrangement, a sense of antiquity.
6. The Kremlin (Russia): Palaces, cathedrals, walls, and towers.
7. Mount Rushmore (USA): Carved presidential faces, facial features, and scale.
8. The White House (USA): Neoclassical architecture, porticos, facade.
9. Himeji Castle (Japan): Traditional Japanese architecture, white exterior.

## TinkerCad design
Begin creating your 3D model in TinkerCad based on your chosen Landmark. Focus on capturing the overall shape and proportions. Experiment with different techniques to enhance the accuracy and realism of your model.

## Feedback Session
At the end of each class, get your kind, specific and helpful peer feedback. Make note of what the feedback was in your notion post and who it came from. Reflect on the feedback received and identify areas for improvement in your design. 

![[Pasted image 20241224152322.png]]
## Refine TinkerCad design
Make necessary adjustments and refinements to your TinkerCad model based on the feedback received. Focus on enhancing details, improving accuracy, and addressing any identified issues or challenges.

## Second Peer Feedback Session
Share your updated TinkerCad design with peers for a second round of feedback. Discuss the changes made since the previous class and solicit additional input on areas that may still require improvement. Make note of what these pieces of constructive feedback were in your Notion post for today.

## Finalize your Design
Review your TinkerCad model to ensure that it is ready for 3D printing. Check for any potential printing issues such as overhangs, unsupported areas, or structural weaknesses. Make any necessary modifications to optimize the design for successful 3D printing while preserving its integrity and authenticity.

## File submission
Follow the [[File submission (TinkerCAD)| file submission standards]] to submit your project.

>[!warning] 
>Let Mr. Jones know when your file is submitted so that I can add it to the print queue

## Reflection questions
Copy paste these questions and answer them in Notion

1. What were the biggest challenges you faced when creating your 3D model, and how did you overcome them?
2. How did you ensure your model maintained accurate scale and proportion?
3. What specific details in your model do you think best represent the landmark or building you chose?
4. How did using reference images or measurements impact the accuracy of your final design?
5. How did the modeling process help you better understand the importance of planning and problem-solving?
6. In what ways did this project improve your understanding of 3D printing and its applications?
7. How does your final model demonstrate growth in your skills compared to when you started the project?
