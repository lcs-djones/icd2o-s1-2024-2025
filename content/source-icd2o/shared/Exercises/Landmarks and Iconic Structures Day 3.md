## Finalize your Design
Review your TinkerCad model to ensure that it is ready for 3D printing. Check for any potential printing issues such as overhangs, unsupported areas, or structural weaknesses. Make any necessary modifications to optimize the design for successful 3D printing while preserving its integrity and authenticity.

## File submission
Follow the [[File submission (TinkerCAD)| file submission standards]] to submit your project.
