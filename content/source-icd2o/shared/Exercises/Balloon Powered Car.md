## Objective
Design and create a balloon-powered car that uses air propulsion to move effectively and efficiently. The car should demonstrate principles of creative design.

The car should include a body, wheels (or an alternative movement system) and a secure and efficient balloon attachment.

## What you'll need to begin
Ensure that you are on our classroom for TinkerCad and review the [[File submission (TinkerCAD)|file submission standards]] as well as the [[3D Printing Principles and Rules]]. You will need a pencil and paper and to find a partner to give and receive peer feedback.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] A hand-drawn plan is made for your car, including a labeled diagram of key features like the body, wheels, and balloon attachment
- [ ] The model has functioning wheels that can rotate during motion
- [ ] You consistently give and receive peer feedback that is used to influence and adapt your design
- [ ] Your design and iteration process is shown throughout the assingment
- [ ] The final model is realistic for 3D printing and adheres to the[[3D Printing Principles and Rules]]

## Sketch and Design
Draw your initial plan for the car on graph paper. Label key elements such as
- [ ] Your design should be at minimum 5 pieces
	- [ ] Body of the car
	- [ ] 2 wheels attached to an axle
	- [ ] 2 wheels to be glued onto the axle after it is inserted into the base of the car
- [ ] The body shape (lightweight and aerodynamic)
- [ ] The placement of wheels or alternative movement mechanism
- [ ] Attachment point of the balloon
- [ ] Scale and sizes
- [ ] Sketched from different views
- [ ] Plan how many parts that your print will be 
>[!Tip]
>>The axle on a car is the "stick" that goes through the body of the car to hold the tires. You will have to print this separately from the car.

When designing you car, remember to make the axle's diameter smaller then the hole on the body of the car that they go into to reduce friction and to allow the axle to spin freely 

To allow the balloon to power your car, the air from the ballon must be pushed through the car and out the back. Here is a cross section view of what that should look like. The red arrow is how the air passes through. 

>[!hint]
>Instead of building your car around a round hole, think about how you can start from a solid block and use the hole function to carve out a rounded curve

Feel free to make your balloon powered car look like/modeled after a real car!
>[!tip] Remember to keep in mind the principles of 3D modeling when sketching and designing.


## Peer Feedback
Show your sketches to a peer. The peer should give you 3 pieces of constructive feedback for your sketches. This feedback can be with regards to your theme, your model printing success or anything else that is relevant. The three pieces of constructed feedback that you receive should be included in your notion post so make sure you write them down!

>[!remember] >Constructive feedback needs to be
>1. Helpful
>2. Specific
>3. Kind

>[!example]
>> "It is really good, I think it looks cool. There is some stuff that you could fix like the top of it" is **KIND**, but it is not **SPECIFIC**, or **HELPFUL**
>> 
>>"The proprotions of your windows are really accurate! The columns are really close to accurate but are a bit off near the top as they look thinner than the real thing. If you use the technique you did for the windows on the columns to get them more accurate, I think it would really elevate your project!" is an example of **GOOD** peer feedback.

## 3D Modelling 



When you are done your car receive one more piece of kind, specific and helpful constructive feedback. Make the recommended change and note of it in your Notion post for today. When your car are done, follow the [[File submission (TinkerCAD)|file submission standards]]. 

>[!todo] Submission 
>Let Mr. Jones know when you have completed a chess piece and [[File submission (TinkerCAD)|submitted properly]], so that I can add it to the print queue.

Reprints will only happen in certain circumstances, so make sure that you get it right!
