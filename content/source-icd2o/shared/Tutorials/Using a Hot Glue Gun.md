## Introduction

A 3D printer creates objects by layering melted strings of filament.

The purpose of this activity is to use the glue from a hot glue gun as if it were the filament that is used to create objects in a 3D printer.

## Exercise 1a: 2D Shapes Border

With your partner, using only the glue from the gun, try making each of the following shapes.

## Exercise 1b: 2D Shapes Filled

Next, try making these 2D shapes filled in.

## Exercise 2a: 3D Shapes Cube

Let's add a dimension. Try to make this one hollow

What parts worked and what parts fell? 
## Exercise 2b: 3D Shapes Solid Cube
Make this next one a solid cube!

## Exercise 2c: 3D Shapes Sail Boat
Alright, let's try something hard.

Great! You now know the basics of 3D printing! Just like a hot glue gun, a 3D printer heats a nozzle that melts a plastic. The nozzle then moves along the design that you provide and excretes the plastic in that shape! 
>[!example]
>As you experienced, 3D printers can't print on thin air! Just like how construction workers need to use scaffolding so that they can stand and build, 3D printed objects need to be able to place the melted plastic on something!

>See any similarities? Once the supports are taken away from the print, you end up with the original design!

Printing with supports is a great help for complex designs, but it uses up plastic and creates a lot of waste! Let's focus on making our designs be printable without supports!

>[!remember]
>To print without supports, make sure that your model:
> -  Has no floating sections
> -  Has no "sharp" angles
> -  Is all connected
> -  Has something to print on (not trying to print on thin air)


## Reflection

In your portfolio for today, copy-and-paste these and provide brief response to each:

1. What challenges did you face when creating your shapes and structures with the hot glue gun?
2. How did the stability of your structure compare to what you expected? Why do you think this happened?
3. How does the process of using a hot glue gun compare to the way you imagine a 3D printer works?
4. What did you learn about the importance of planning before creating a 3D model?
